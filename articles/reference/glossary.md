# Glossary

This section contains words and concepts used in SimpleAR's code.

* **attribute/column**: In the code, attribute and column words are often used.
They don't exactly mean the same thing: attributes refer to model's properties
whereas columns refer to to database table's fields. Of course they may be named
the same, but distinction is important when building queries.

* **relation**: Association between models.
